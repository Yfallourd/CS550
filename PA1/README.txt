HOW TO SETUP :

There is no makefile or ant as this is a python project.

To run, move the corresponding folder to where you want your peer/server to run and execute the following command inside of it :

python3 <nameoffile>.py

The communication is then done via stdin

Alternatively you can simply run the files using your favorite Python IDE.


! IMPORTANT !

This program has been written using Python3, it will NOT work using Python2 !!
This program is also intended to be run on the same machine ! Each file has to be on the same machine but in different directories with files at each directory's top level.
